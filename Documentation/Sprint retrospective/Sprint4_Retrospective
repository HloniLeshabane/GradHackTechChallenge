#### Sprint goal
-The goal for this week is to create functionality for users to meet using live maps. 


#### Duration of Sprint: 1 week (7 days)

#### Moderation

The web app now has a more face-to-face meeting functionality. The chatroom is functional with messages being stored in an sql database. 
The testing of the database functions have not been implemented yet because of the difficulty in mocking and closing the database connection as Jest 
throws a timeout error and a connection error. Some major user stories have been carried over to the next sprint due to difficulty in modeling
some situations as set forth in the brief in the web app.

#### Goal: 
The next sprint will see fully featured map integration. A comprehensive testing of database functionality. The delayed/in-progress user stories
that have not been completed will be finished along with the upcoming user stories. 

#### Velocity and Business Value for sprint

- Points for 9 user stories: 55
- Points for un-completed user stories: 28

                                #### Achieved Velocity for Sprint 1: 55 - 28 = 27
