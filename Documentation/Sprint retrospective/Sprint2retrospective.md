#### Duration of Sprint: (8 days)

#### Moderation
In this sprint, Focus was on making the app more interactive by interacting with the back-end that is created using SQL server on Azure. The UI/UX was also implememented for most of the user substories.Whilst most of the issues were implemented okay, the UI/UX for the search task is not yet dydnamic and needs to be done in the next sprint.

- Issue #95 is  not yet implemented,thus its status is still in progress and will be carried over to the next sprint.

#### Shortcomings

- Too many merge conflicts.
- lack of exhaustive testing.

###possible improvements
-Come up with better strategy to avoid editing the same files.
-We can start commiting early to avoid conflicts and avoid waiting for other predessessor code.

#### Goal: The web must be fully dynamic.
