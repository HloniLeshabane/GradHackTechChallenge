# ADR1: SQL and MongoDB database

Database is mainly used for security and management of information.In this project, the database is needed for managing students, groups details etc. The two databases allowed to be used for this project are SQL and MongoDB.

SQL database uses a high-level language to access,review and query information. SQL can be set-up on Azure and Github which make things easy as the two are required platforms for this project.

MongoDB is not natively linked to Azure hence it would require more effort to succesfully link MongoDB on Azure.
