#### Scrum master @Mukz98 for group -011

#### Sprint goal
The goal for this sprint was to have a fully functional back-end implementation.


#### Duration of Sprint: 1 week (7 days)

#### Moderation.
Most of the tasks completed in this sprint are those that were carried over from previous sprints. There are only few completed tasks that were specifically assigned for this sprint.
This is because the back-end implementetion is complex and is taking longer than expected. All tasks that are not completed will be carried over to sprint 6. Sprint 6 mainly has tasks that
are to better what is already implemented.
Some tasks that were carried over from the previous sprint are still in progress and are to be completed in the first few days of the next sprint.

#### Shortcomings

- Too many uncompleted tasks for this sprint.
- lack of exhaustive testing.

###possible improvements
-Ask for help early to get assistance from other group members.

#### Goal: Finish all features and only be left with testing and polishing UI/UX.

#### Velocity and Business Value for sprint

- Points for 33 user stories: 153         (including carried over)
-Points for  un-completed user stories: 103

                                #### Achieved Velocity for Sprint 1: 153 - 103 = 50
