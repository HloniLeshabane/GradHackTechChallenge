#### Sprint goal
-The goal for make ui for several routes more pleasant to behold and finish up on user stories that have not been completed.


#### Duration of Sprint: 1 week (7 days)

#### Moderation

The web app now host live meeting sessions for multiple groups. The various routes are connected in the application and placeholder 
html text has been removed for some routes and replaced with functional code. The voting system and calculating the best location 
for meeting still are yet to be completed. The maps can however display the correct point of locations that users signed up with. The
issue with maps was caused by socket.io creating multiple requests when a user refreshes a page.

#### Goal: 
The next sprint will be a complete and functional app with testing to show that the app behaves according to the requirements.
The maps will present a suitable location to meet with the option of a proposed location by any user in a group

#### Velocity and Business Value for sprint

                                #### Achieved Velocity for Sprint 6: 50 - 30 = 20
