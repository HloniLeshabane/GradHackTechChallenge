#### Scrum master: @Allen1412 for group -011

#### Sprint goal
-The goal was to complete core features of the app and to test most of the fuctionalities already implemeted.


#### Duration of Sprint: 1 week (7 days and few more hours)

#### Moderation

Most of te major features of te app are operational. An email is sent to a loged-in user once they get invited to join the group or another loged-in user want to be part of one of their groups. Most of the functionality is well tested. Most issues were not completed.

#### Recommendations: 
The voting  system needs to be associated with each group whenever neccessary as per specifications. Seperation of layers can be made excellent by seperating different sections of the code into folders. More tests need to be implemented.

#### Velocity and Business Value for sprint

- Points for  user stories: 45
- Points for un-completed user stories: 35

                                #### Achieved Velocity for Sprint 7: 45 - 35 = 10
